## Object Orientation Challenge: SIM CITY

It's time to take everything you've learned so far and put it in to real-life practice.

SimCity is a game from the 1990s where you build and manage a virtual city. You have to manage the population and make the city thrive by building roads, power plants, schools, fire and police departments, tourist attractions and more. On top of that, you have to manage the city budget by raising taxes from your population and allocating your city's spending correctly.

You'll be building a command line based version of Sim City with your group. We're leaving this project pretty open ended - you decide what your app can and cannot do.

Follow these steps with your group and build out an awesome simulation!

+ On a whiteboard, think about your city. What models do you want to include (city, building, person, vehicle, etc...)

+ For each model, map out the different attributes and actions that it shoudl include.

+ Start building - Make sure to start small, test your app frequently, and build out from there. Since you're working in groups, **COMMUNICATION IS KEY!!!** Talk through your problems out loud, encourage each other, make sure you're switching off the driver and navigator roles.
